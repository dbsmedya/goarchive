# IMPORTANT: This is a template file. You must configure the credentials below
# before running integration tests. Copy this file and fill in your values, or
# use the Makefile target: make integration-config
#
# The integration tests require two MySQL databases (source and destination).
# These can be:
#   - Local Docker containers (see tests/compose.yml)
#   - Remote test databases
#   - Any MySQL-compatible databases

# List of databases used in integration tests
databases:
  - name: source
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 3305
    user: root
    # REQUIRED: Set your database password
    # Can also use MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD environment variable
    password: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
    # Database will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
    database: goarchive_test

  - name: destination
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 3307
    user: root
    # REQUIRED: Set your database password
    # Can also use MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD environment variable
    password: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
    # Database will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
    database: goarchive_test

# Set to true to drop and recreate databases on each test run
# Can also be set via INTEGRATION_FORCE=true environment variable
